<h1 align="left">Brian - Detailed Description </h1>
<p>Brian is a motivated, hardworking student who has had great  success in his classes. He does not have an inherent interest in science but is  motivated by good grades. He is well-organized and systematic about his work. Brian  responds well to structure and routine. Brian&rsquo;s reasoning and logic tend to be  generalized and &ldquo;black and white,&rdquo; creating difficulty when he is asked to  describe his thinking processes or when asked to distinguish fine details. He  is strategic in his use of learning materials, such as reference materials; if  he&rsquo;s stuck he knows where to go for help. Brian needs extended time to process  and respond to information and questions. Test preparation and test-taking are  particularly impacted by these difficulties. He has, however, discovered that  having his parents, a teacher, or a trusted peer quiz him orally on information  helps him remember it better.</p>
