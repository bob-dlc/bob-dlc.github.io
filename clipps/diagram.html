<h1>Scaffolding Graphical Interpretation</h1>
<p>Students' ability to interpret science-based graphical and digrammatic information varies widely. Nonetheless, interpretation and comprehension of such media is a critically important skill in science. Rather than withholding such media from students in an attempt to reduce barriers to learning, CLIPPS focuses on provided students with individualized built-in scaffolds for interpreting graphical information. Below is a diagram shown in four different renditions, ranging from most highly scaffolded to unscaffolded.</p>
<table width="850" border="0">
  <tr>
    <td valign="top"><h2>1) Narrative Tour </h2>
    <p>In this version of the diagram, the grasshopper acts as an agent and highlights  critical features of the photosynthesis process in a narrative/story-based  format. The grasshopper fills in connections to lived  experience and importance. The information is displayed as printed  text in the speech bubble with concurrent voice-over. The  student can replay the animation if desired. </p>
    </td>
    <td valign="top"><h2>3) Sequenced Presentation</h2>
      <p>This version of the diagram is an animation of the photosynthesis process, showing the  various (conspicuous) steps in  sequence. As each step is displayed, the <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/archives/000558.php" title="http://www.37signals.com/svn/archives/000558.php" rel="nofollow">yellow fade technique</a> is employed to draw attention to the change. The sequence is  cumulative; previous stages remain visible as new steps are added. The  student can replay the animation if desired. </p></td>

    <td height="82" valign="top"><h2>3) Annotated Diagram</h2>
      This version of the diagram is not &ldquo;animated.&rdquo;  Instead, &ldquo;<strong>hot spots</strong>&rdquo; are strategically located on the diagram.  When the student mouses-over the hot spots, the <strong>cricket speech bubble text is replaced with annotation text</strong> which supplements the information presented in the original diagram.</td>
    <td valign="top"><h2>4) Static Diagram</h2>
      <p>This is the original diagram without any interpretation supports.</p></td>
