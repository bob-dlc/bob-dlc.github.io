<h1 align="left">Alita - Detailed Description </h1>
<p>Alita is a wonderful young woman with a great sense of  humor. She benefits from consistency and trust in her adult interactions, and  has many positive relationships with her teachers. She participates actively in  classroom discussions and she tends to learn new concepts better when they&rsquo;re  tied directly to real world experiences; she requires concrete examples,  especially of abstract concepts. She attends well to oral directions and  lectures during her academic classes, but has difficulty connecting the  assignments and activities to the content discussed. Unless examples are given  during oral directions, Alita has a difficult time following more than one at a  time or understanding why an activity may be done a certain way. She doesn&rsquo;t  always know when or how to ask for the help she needs. Oral repetition,  flashcards, routines, and time for Alita to discuss her understanding of  concepts with her teachers all help her be successful. Alita also likes to dive  right into the details. Her reading level is significantly below grade level.  Alita has cognitive disabilities that manifest in her schoolwork, but wouldn&rsquo;t  be obvious in social interactions other than her being somewhat immature. Alita  is good-natured and compliant, showing a desire to do well&mdash;especially on  creative projects in her classes. Alita&rsquo;s favorite project this year was  writing a hip-hop song about the Chinese take-over of Tibet.<br clear="all" />
