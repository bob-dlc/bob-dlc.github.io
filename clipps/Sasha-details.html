<h1>Sasha - Detailed Description </h1>
<p>Sasha is a highly verbal, strong reader, with a very high  content interest in science and math. He prefers relating to abstract concepts  rather than connecting his knowledge to real life scenarios. He reads above  grade-level and has a well-developed vocabulary in oral and written expression.  However, he does not <em>enjoy</em> reading and writing and often goes to  extreme lengths to avoid those tasks. Sasha also has a unique ability to  visualize abstract concepts and represent them using hands-on manipulatives or  computer-based drawing tools. In fact, Sasha enjoys using computers in and out  of school and accepts directed learning in a computerized environment much more  readily than from another person. Explaining learned concepts to others is a  challenge for Sasha, and unless there is an immediate reward or feedback he is  unwilling to pursue a deeper level of understanding for himself. Attention and  focus are significant issues, often preventing Sasha from accessing his  strengths as a learner. Sasha has been labeled as a student with high  functioning autism with commensurate attention deficit disorder and executive  function challenges.</p>
